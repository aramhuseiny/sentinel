# Sentinel

Hedi/Sentinel developed based on Cartalyst/Sentinel to extend its capability to support hierarchical in organizations to add roles of employees to their manager.
This help up to implement organization hierarchy and assign roles to user by their scope in the organization.
In this model, roles does not assign to users directly. Role will assign to scope in hierarchy and users place in a scope. 
Implicitly the roles assigned to user. Managers have their employees roles by default.
